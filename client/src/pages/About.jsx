          <h2>üåø How TrueLeaf Started</h2>
          <p>
            It all began with a simple question: "How can we grow our own fresh,
            nutritious food in a small urban apartment?" What started as curiosity
            about indoor gardening quickly became a passion for microgreens‚Äîthose
            tiny, nutrient-packed seedlings that pack more vitamins and minerals
            than their full-grown counterparts.
          </p>
          <p>
            We transformed a corner of our living space into a mini growing operation,
            experimenting with different seeds, growing mediums, and techniques.
            The first harvest of sunflower microgreens was a revelation‚Äîthe fresh,
            nutty flavor and incredible nutrition density convinced us we were onto something special.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our friends and neighbors tasted our microgreens, word spread about
            these "superfood seedlings" grown right in the heart of the city. What
            began as a personal project evolved into TrueLeaf Microgreens, a small
            business committed to providing fresh, locally grown nutrition to our community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we're proud to offer five varieties of premium microgreens,
            each grown with sustainable practices and harvested at peak nutrition.
            Every batch is a testament to our belief that fresh, healthy food
            shouldn't require massive farms or long supply chains‚Äîsometimes the
            best nutrition comes from the smallest spaces.
